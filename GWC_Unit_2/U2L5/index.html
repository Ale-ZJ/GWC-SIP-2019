    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Hi, my name is Alexandra and I am part of Girls Who Code! I am a very curious girl and I am always excited to learn more about everyhing under and above the sun.
        I moved from Panama (ptss, Central America) to the United States last year. Everything is so different and amazing. I am eager to share my experiences and learn more about this new place.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        I <em>love</em> to read manga, and watch anime and children series in my free time. Also, I love math. Just to clarify, I do not mean that I am a pro at math and that I can solve any problem just by looking at it. In fact, I can stay for hours staring at the same problem without having the most little clue of what to do.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        To <strong><em>emphasize my love for anime and math</em></strong>, I will include the their own headlines below!
      </p>


    <h2>ANIME</h2>
      <p class="color">Some of my favorite titles are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
          <li id="item"><a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/One_Piece_Wiki">One Piece</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://tokyoghoul.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_Ghoul_Wiki">Tokyo Ghoul</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://akatsukinoyona.fandom.com/wiki/Akatsuki_No_Yona_Wiki">Yona of the Dawn</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="intro">
        Ahhh, sorry. I tried to make this part nicest, but no time :c
      </p>


    <h2>MATH</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      <em>AHHHHHH, I didn't have time for this part :c</em>
    </p>

    <p class="color">
      Whatever, I love math because there is always a hundreds ways to find <strong>a solution</strong>. You can even combine totally different and errant techniques to find a solution to a problem. Solving math problems have showed me that if you have a problem in your life, you can indeed stare at it for hours, having absolute no idea what to do, feeling lost and insecure, I remember that just as in math, there are <strong><em>bizillions</em></strong> of different methods to get to your goal.
    </p>
    <p class="color">
      Another cool thing about math is that with super basic knowledge you can solve very complex problems! I planned to include a problem, but <em>yikes</em>, I did not have enough time.
